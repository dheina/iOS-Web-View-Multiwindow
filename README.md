iOS-Web-View-Multiwindow
========================

Repository for Xcode example project demonstrating how to support multiple windows when using UIWebView.

This project is intended to be a demo only, not a final app. Use the code as needed in your app project to get multi-window support working. 

Though this is a very basic app project, the code is well commented to explain what important parts of the code are doing. Log statements are included in certain places to alert the developer where certain JavaScript window overrides are caught for a quick and easy way to see when windows are created, destroyed, and how many instances of UIWebView are being used.
